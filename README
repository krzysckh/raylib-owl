raylib bindings for owl lisp (using custom sys primops)

this sucks, and i need to come up with some better api for writing extensions,
but for now - it is what it is.

TODOS:
  * [ ] ol-rl
    * [x] works
    * [ ] embed (raylib) into ol-rl
    * [ ] embed the raylib runtime into ol-rl
    * [ ] compile ol-rl without owl sources on the os
